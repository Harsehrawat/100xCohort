Things to know in FE Framework :
flex , grid , responsiveness and bgColor,hover .

-- Grid ex. 
<div className="grid-cols-12">
    <div className="col-span-7">Hi</div>
    <div className="col-span-5>There</div>
</div>
: This way i delcared a grid of 12cols and i decided to give hi div 5cols and there div 7cols 


-- responsiveness : We can apply styles to diff screensizes bason on responsive breakpoints.
                     sm : 640px 
                     md : 768px
                     lg : 1024px
                     xl : 1280px
                     2xl: 1536px

    * In responsiveness .. if i've set for ex. <div className= "md:bg-blue bg-pink"/> 
                           then pink colour will appear if the ss if less than 768px. 
                           but the moment it reaches md size bg colour would be blue .
                           The catch here is since nothing else is delcared so if even 
                           i put it on TV screensize -> the bg colour would be still blue.
