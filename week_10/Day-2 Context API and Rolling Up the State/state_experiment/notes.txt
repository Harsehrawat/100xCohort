-- Props Drilling 
* Occurs when u need to pass the data from higer level component down to lower level component that is several layers deep in the component tree .
It often leads to issues like : COmplexity Incr. and Unreadabilty

-- Way to avoid Props Drilling { use ContextAPI}
* 1. Context : It serves as a container for the data you want to share .
     ex. for whatsapp-> Context = [messages],
        for linkedIn -> Context = [posts]

    In example . in Context ,, store the values or props u wana pass down the component tree.

* 2. Provider : this component wraps part of your application and provides the context value to all its descendents
                {any component taht is child of this provider can access the context}

* 3. Consume : How to consume from the Provider ? 
            -> use useContext(Context_Name).
            ex. const {bulbOn} = useContext(Context);
