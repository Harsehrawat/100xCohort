When you write buttonEl.onclick = deleteToDo(index);, the function deleteToDo(index) is executed immediately when that line of code runs, and the result of that function (which is undefined in this case) is assigned to buttonEl.onclick. This means that instead of setting up an event handler, you're immediately calling the function and assigning its return value to the onclick event, which is not the desired behavior.

Why You Need a Function Reference:
When you use buttonEl.onclick = function() { deleteToDo(index); };, you're not calling the function immediately. Instead, you're passing a function reference (an anonymous function in this case) that will be executed when the button is clicked. This anonymous function, when invoked by the click event, will then call deleteToDo(index) with the correct index.

Example to Illustrate the Difference:
Immediate Execution:


javascript
Copy code
buttonEl.onclick = deleteToDo(index);
This line calls deleteToDo(index) right away during the assignment, and buttonEl.onclick is set to whatever deleteToDo(index) returns, which is undefined. As a result, nothing happens when the button is clicked.

Delayed Execution:

javascript
Copy code
buttonEl.onclick = function() {
    deleteToDo(index);
};
This line assigns a function (an anonymous function) to buttonEl.onclick. This function contains the call to deleteToDo(index) and will only be executed when the button is clicked. This ensures that deleteToDo(index) is called with the correct index at the right time.
