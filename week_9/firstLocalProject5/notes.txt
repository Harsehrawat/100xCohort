In THis I learn about 2 ways we can pass childeren/props to the function

for ex. Card is a function 
-- so we can pass to card by 2 following ways : 
    1. <Card children = { ' content '}/>
    2. <Card> content </Card>

-- also while accepting this children into card function use { content } as arguemnts of card function
