In this .. I will learning to re-render posts using setState .

For this In Post.jsx -> contains structure and rendering of my post components

Now inside App.jsx -> First i imported PostCOmponent defined in Post.jsx

I have 2 functions ->
1. <PostCOmponent /> in which i've to pass props and send to render it 
2. addPost function which is an array of all posts .

How addPost works ?

const [posts,setPosts] = useState([]) // declared an empty array of posts and it's setState

// for each click on addPost button , i've to collect postObject of resp. post and send to render it .
1. how do i collect postObject on each addPost button click?
-> function addPost(){
    // always use setVariables
    setPosts([...posts],{
        image : "imgLink",
        name : "harsh",
        subtitle : "221 followers"
        time : "2m age"
        description : "harsh is good "
    })
}

// collect postObject and add them at the end of current posts array using [...posts]

2. how do i send to render it to <PostCOmponent /> ?
-> from collected postObjects inside posts array , convert it to post components that would be send to render to PostCOmponent function
    const postComponents = posts.map(post => <PostCOmponent 
        image : {posts.image},
        name : {post.name},
        subtitle : {posts.subtitle},
        time : {posts.time},
        description : {posts.description}
        /> 
        )


* now just send this postComponents to get rendered
