* DIfferences b/w Class and Functional component.

--State Management:
  Class Component: Uses the state object to manage state.
  Functional Component: Uses the useState hook for state management.
--Lifecycle Methods:
  Class Component: Relies on lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
  Functional Component: Handles lifecycle logic using hooks like useEffect.
--Syntax and Boilerplate:
  Class Component: Requires a render() method and the this keyword to access props and methods.
  Functional Component: Directly returns JSX without needing a render() method or this keyword.
--Performance:
  Class Component: Slightly heavier due to the class overhead.
  Functional Component: More lightweight and performs slightly better.
