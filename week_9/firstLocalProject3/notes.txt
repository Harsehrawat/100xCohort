* Generally useEffect to be used when :
-- fetching data from an API Call
-- modifying the DOM Manually
-- subscribing to events
-- starting a clock

* structure of useEffect
-- useEffect( function(){

}, []);

* what if i also had a useEffect with a state var. count inside dependency array ?
-- useEffect( () => {

}, [count]) 

-> in this case, this useEffect will run everytime the statevar. value chagnes {i.e. count changes} , rather than only running once during mounting


* setCount ( count){
    return count + 1;
}

can be written as :

-- setCount(count => count+1);
