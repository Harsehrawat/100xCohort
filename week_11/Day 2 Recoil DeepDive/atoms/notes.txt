Atom : think of atom just like useState only just it's the recoil way to do it and are more optimal 

-- Structure of atom :
* atom({
    key : " ",
    default : num or "stirng"
})

-- Remember atoms use RecoilHooks and any component taht uses recoil hook needs to be wrapped inside recoil root

-- Types of RecoilHooks ?
* 1. useRecoilValue  (to grab value)
  2. useRecoilState   ( to grab value as well as fetch setAtomState)
  3. useSetRecoilState (to update state of atom w/out grabbing value)


  -- Selectors : a selector is something that is derived from other atoms
