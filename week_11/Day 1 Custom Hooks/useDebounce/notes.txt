-- what is debounce used for ?
* while typing in amazon searchbar we keep getting suggestion as we keep typing words .
    but suppose someone is typing really really fast so ideally in this case you won't be sending backend 
    https req. to server for each word he wrote and asking for suggestion as it would be overload on system 
    as well as the time u sent him suggesiton he would've types 3/4 words more.
    For this case what we ideally do is we set a timer i.e. 20ms ; so if the typer doesn't type for this timer 
    then only we send http backend req. otherwise we keep waiting for him to compelte typing first.

-- how do we keep waiting till he is finished and send backend http after 20ms ?
* using useDebounce hook .
    S:1 Declaration -> const useDebounce = (inputVal, delay) => {

    }
    
    S:2 Initialise state var.-> const useDebounce = (inputVal, delay) => {
        const [debounce ,setdebounceVal] = useState(inputVal);

        
    }

    S:3 Enter the return -> const useDebounce = (inputVal, delay) => {
        const [debounce ,setdebounceVal] = useState(inputVal);

        return debounce;        
    }

    S:4 Fill the useEffect -> const useDebounce = (inputVal, delay) => {
        const [debounce ,setdebounceVal] = useState(inputVal);

        useEffect( ()=>{
            let currClock = setTimeOut( ()=>{
                setdebounceVal(inputVal);
            },delay );

            return ()=>{
                clearInterval(currClock);
            }
        },[inputVal,delay]);

        return debounce;
        
    }
