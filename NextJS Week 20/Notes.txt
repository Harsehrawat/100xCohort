What is next auth ?
next auth is library that lets u authenticate in next.js  .
can u do it w/out next auth : yes  , should u do it w/out next auth : probably not .

Why not use JWT + LocalStorage ?
we are using nextJs for SSR, if we use JWT + localStorage to ƒetch the api once the page is loaded, then it is a CSR 
rather than a SSR, killing the purpose of nextJS .
And as nextJs server don't has access to your localStorage item so can't use JWT + LocalStorage method of authenticating
 

** PTR : If u want to add a onClick to a button inside a component , to make it work add "use client" on top of file **

Set up of nextAuth . 
first paste this code : 
{
    import NextAuth  from "next-auth";

    const handler = NextAuth();

    export {handler as GET, handler as POST};
}
inside NextAuth we gona pass the providers as the parameter .


How do i process all the outcomes of it in my HomePage ..
nextJs provides us with useSession() stateHook accessing which we can 
write "authenticated" or "unauthenticated" and get to know the current active status .
// PTR. this useSession() must be wrapped inside <ServiceProvider>  </ServiceProvider> .
// But this is a CSR as it's a react component .
* use getServerSession to enable SSR 
for getServerSession , inside route.tsx , along with providers, mention your NextAuth_SECRET .


//-- PTR //
✅ useSession() gives "authenticated" / "unauthenticated" status.
✅ Must use <SessionProvider> when using useSession().
✅ Don't use getServerSession() in Client Components — it's for Server Components only.
✅ "use client" is required for using onClick, hooks, and interactive React logic.
