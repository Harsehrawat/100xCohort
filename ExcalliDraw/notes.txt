*Used pnpm rather than npm
*made it a turbo-repo project

*added package.json to http-backend and ws-backend using npm init -y inside apps directory

-- Steps i did before writing actual code --
* initialised an empty turbo repo
* deleted the docs apps
* added http-backend, ws-backend
* added package.json in both the places
* added tsconfig.json in both the places and imported it from @repo/typescript-config/base.json 
* added @repo/typescript-config as a dependency in both ws-backend and http-backend 
* added a build, dev and start to both the places n 
* update the turbo-config in both the places 
* initialise a http server, a websocket server 
* initialise a new 'db' package where you write the schema of the project
* import the db package into the http-layer where u'll start putting the things in the db 
* add a common package where we add the zod schema and the JWT_SECRET .


-- inside db --
* pnpm install prisma -> npx prisma init -> get postgreDB from neon.tech -> npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema
